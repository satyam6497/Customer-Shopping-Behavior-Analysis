## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 🐍 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python)
- Loaded and explored dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Imputed missing values in the *Review Rating* column using median values per category  
- Created derived features:
  - `age_group` – segmented customers by age  
  - `purchase_frequency_days` – measured engagement level  
- Standardized column names and connected Python to **PostgreSQL** for SQL analysis
